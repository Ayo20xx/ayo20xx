Hey there 👋

I’m Ayomide — a Python-focused developer learning by building real projects.

I’m interested in backend development, automation, and applied AI.  
Right now, my main goal is to strengthen my fundamentals, ship practical projects, and grow into a solid backend / AI engineer over time.

I enjoy breaking problems down, writing clean code, and improving one step at a time.

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Deepening my Python fundamentals (data structures, error handling, file handling)
- Building small backend and automation projects
- Learning Flask for APIs and backend services
- Exploring AI & machine learning concepts through hands-on experiments

- **Language:** Python  
- **Backend:** Flask (learning), REST APIs  
- **Data:** JSON, basic SQL concepts  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Command Line
